Project Name: E-Banking System
Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT), React.js, Razorpay, Redis, MySQL, REST API, Axios, Bootstrap Dark

Short Description (For Interview)
---------------------------------
“This is a full-stack online banking system where users can register, verify OTP, log in, and manage their bank accounts. 
Users can deposit money using Razorpay, transfer funds, check balances, and view transactions. 
Admins can approve new accounts, view users, block/unblock accounts, and view transactions. 
The backend is built with Spring Boot + JWT, and the frontend is a modern React UI.”

Deep Explanation (2–3 Minutes)
------------------------------

1. Authentication & Security
- Implemented stateless authentication using Spring Security + JWT.
- Created a custom JWT filter for validating tokens on every request.
- Implemented password hashing, validation, and role-based access control.
- Used custom exception handlers for a clean API experience.

2. User Onboarding & OTP Flow
- On registration, user data and OTP are stored temporarily in Redis.
- OTP is sent via email, user must verify before creating the account.
- Ensures security and prevents duplicate registrations.

3. Bank Account Module
- Users can create a savings account with full validation (name, PAN, Aadhar, address).
- Accounts remain inactive until approved by an Admin.
- Admin can approve, block, or unblock any account.

4. Razorpay Deposit Integration
- Backend creates Razorpay orders using the Razorpay SDK.
- React opens Razorpay checkout for payment.
- On success, backend verifies payment and creates a transaction entry.
- Updates balance and transaction history.

5. Transactions & Balance
- Every deposit/transfer creates a BankTransaction record.
- Tracks previous balance, new balance, amount, type (credit/debit), timestamp.
- Users can check balance, transfer funds, and view transaction history.

6. Admin Dashboard
- View all users
- View pending accounts
- Approve accounts
- Block/unblock accounts
- View bank account details
- View all transactions

7. Frontend Architecture
- Built with React + React Router + Axios.
- Fully responsive modern dark-mode UI.
- Toast notifications for realtime feedback.
- Token interceptor included in Axios.
- Clean component structure.
